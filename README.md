## Deliverables

The expected deliverables are a project report, source code, and (optionally) a presentation.
The project report must discuss the following items:
1. problem statement/motivation,
2. description of the approach and method used,
3. complexity analysis (both time and space) in detail,
4. description of experiments and datasets used,
5. results and discussion, including correctness, validation, and performance,
6. challenges faced and lessons learned.
7. (Advisable) GitHub project link for the source code and its supporting files (as mentioned below).


The source code must be a clean and well-commented implementation of the algorithm, and should be
submitted with the following supporting files: a README file with instructions or scripts to run the code,
and test cases in text format/JSON files, including example inputs. It is advisable that a GitHub project
link be given in the report for the source code instead of separate source files.
The optional presentation can be in 5-6 slides summarizing the project, a video demonstration of the
working of the code, etc. This will only need to be included in the submission, and there will be no class
presentation (oral) or viva voce for this.
